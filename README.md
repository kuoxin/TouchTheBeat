TouchTheBeat is a HTML5 multi-touch game currently in development. 

The Game
----------
TouchTheBeat is **level-based**. Each level consists of a song and a composition of interactive objects. The objects can be either tapped ~~, hold, dragged or slided~~ _(soon)_. The more **rhythmically accurate** you interact with the objects, the more points you get in the end.

The Level-Builder
----------
You can easily create your own levels by using any **SoundCloud track** as music for your level. When finished, you might share and exchange your levels online in text-format. This way it is easy to **play levels created by others**.

Development
----------
TouchTheBeat is currently in active development and you are testing an early version. The finished game may be completely different than the current version. I am glad about every feedback you may give to me. You can give feedback by pressing the button below.
